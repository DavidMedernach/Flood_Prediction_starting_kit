## What is the purpose of this starting kit?

This repository allows every participant to run a complete pipeline to process the data, train a model, and create a submission file to predict the flood risk maps on the secret test set. After following the instruction on this Readme page, you will obtain a .csv file that you can submit on the Codabench challenge page to appear on the leaderboard.

The model proposed on this starting kit is our baseline model. Your objective is to improve it or create a completely different model to beat our score and get the highest ranking possible!
